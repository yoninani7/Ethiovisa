                    We offer a unique and fresh perspective for educational consulting. We approach educational consulting from a different background than many. Rather than coming to consulting from an educational background, we have real world, corporate experience. This knowledge and experience is invaluable when it comes to offering guidance on majors and career choices.

                    Students and parents often feel overwhelmed by the college selection and admissions process and 
                    many do not make the best possible choice when choosing a college. An independent educational consultant (IEC) 
                    can be a valuable resource during the college search and application process. Students and their families choose 
                    to work with an educational consultant because the consultant provides them with tailored, personal attention, 
                    augmented by extensive experience and knowledge. An educational consultant can help to guide you through the 
                    intricacy of college admissions. We will take the time to thoroughly
                     understand a student’s strengths and desires, and provide information 
                     and guidance in finding colleges that are a good fit for the unique needs of the student.

                    You can begin working with an independent educational consultant at any time through high school.
                     We are prepared to initiate the college selection and application process at any point 
                     in a student’s high school career, whether that is in the freshman or sophomore year, beginning 
                     of the junior year or even the summer before or beginning of the senior year. We can help the student 
                     plan their courses for the four years of high school and keep them on track as they progress through the 
                     college selection and application process. During the student’s freshman or sophomore year of high school, 
                     we assist in course planning, suggest extra-curricular activities, and provide guidance regarding summer 
                     activities. Starting with the junior year, we offer guidance on what tests the student will need to take,
                      what preparation, if any, is required prior to the tests and we help the student create a list of colleges 
                      that meet his/her needs academically, socially and financially. We also offer assistance through 
                    each step of the application process, review essays, and prepare students for campus visits and interviews.

                     and their parents. During this discussion, we will answer any questions you may have, describe the type of
                      services that we offer and acquire information about the student. If you should decide after this meeting
                     that you don’t want to continue with our services, you are under no obligation to do so and incur no costs.
